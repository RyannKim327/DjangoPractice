### How to start
> First thing is you need to install the `Virtual Environment` or `Virtualenv` on your device `pip install virtualenv`. Then after you install the *Virtual Environment*, you need to add your virtual environment on your project, just type to your terminal `virtualenv venv`. The most common name of your environment is `venv`, if you want to have `collaborators`, `venv` is the best name because it is universal. Next is activate the script by executing this to your terminal:
```Bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
>And lastly, if you want to finish or deactivate the virtual environmane, just type:
```Bash
deactivate
```
> to your terminal.

### What is the purpose of using Virtual Environment
> It is to avoid the different errors you may have to your entire device, sprcially some data might be deleted. So the `Virtual Environment` is a way for you to protect your device, it creates a viretual storage or emulation of your device.
